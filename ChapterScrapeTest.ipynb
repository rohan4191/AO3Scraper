      "Edit: 31 October 2019\n",
      "I should be sleeping. I should be working on school work. But no. No. I just have to be on A Song of Ice & Fire kick. I know my muse is giggling their ass off at my expense, surrounded by friggin' plot-bunnies that she loves to fling at me unexpectedly when she thinks I have too much focus on one thing\n",
      "I hope you're all happy.\n",
      "Some Notes of Things Mentioned in the Chapter:\n",
      "1: Aikido\n",
      "Aikido... I made Ana Marino know this for a reason. The poor woman has to have a fighting fucking chance in terms of self-defense in Westeros, and if Cersei Lannister couldn't bitch and whine her way into learning how to fight with a sword then I doubt Areli will have a much better chance. It really won't play a big part as far as the earlier chapters beyond a mention of her practicing katas, because that's not the most important thing. I also honestly think that everyone, especially woman, should know some form of self-defense. I have no formal training myself, but I know the weak spots(groin, eyes, stomach, instep, crock of the elbow, back of the neck, fingers), and I always carry something heavy(my big ass, heavy metal water bottle), pepper-spray, and a pocket knife with me at all times. It may not be Westeros, but I've already been nearly mugged in my life twice and followed a couple of times(ah, big city life). In terms of the story, no-weapon self-defense isn't, let's say, the best thing to go up against heavily-armored men with fucking broadswords, but it keeps you nimble, keeps you fast, and it isn't in Areli's nature to be vicious without provocation, so her stance will probably be more akin to get the buggering fuck away from anyone, and surprise the fuck out of anyone when she goes in with a few select hits and maneuvers.\n",
      "2: Most babies eyes settle for six months, but can change up to when they're three years old(at least for Caucasians, less pigment).\n",
      "3: Reflex smiles end at 2 months, and babies for real at about three months, which, coincidentally gives us an exact time frame for anyone who's curious.\n",
      "Year: 366, three months after Joanna's death. Time's a little blurry for Areli. But give her a break, reincarnation is a confusing business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaime I & Areli II\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaime is careful when he sneaked to see his brother and younger sister.\n",
      "Soon after their birth, the quick and confusing funeral where they laid their beautiful, warm mother to rest, strange stones blocking her eyes from seeing the world she left, the Septon whispering of removing the sight of the sinful world to allow her to enter the Seven Heavens without regrets... Jaime realized that no one wanted to talk about the younger twins of House Lannister. At least, no one wanted to be caught talking about his new brother and sister. Because everyone was talking about them, quietly, and saying words that both confuse and Jaime understands are unkind. Just like every time his father left for King's Landing, Casterly Rock seemed to take a break, every one slightly more relaxed as they went about their days.\n",
      "The servents whisper behind rough hands. Of monsters and of the rains and how the Gods punish the wicked. Jaime doesn't understand. Tyrion and Areli are not monsters. They are small and sweet and coo and barely do anything. Monsters are large and evil- they gobble up little boys and girls- Uncle Gerion said so. The other members of the House, his uncles, his aunt, they all say the same thing. The fact that they won't live. That the two strange-looking things are going to follow his mother to the Seven Heavens.\n",
      "But Jaime knew better.\n",
      "He heard what Maester Curwin had said to his Lord Father. Tyrion and Areli are going to live, and that means that they are his to protect, just like Cersei was. Just like Mother told him. Little brothers and sisters were for the eldest boy to protect and Jaime always took his Mother's words seriously. So he came to visit his brother and sister, it is once again, in the dead of night. He is careful, making sure Cersei is asleep in bed next to him, and that it is just before the guards change shift. He is smart enough to get past men and into the quiet, slightly familiar space of the Rock's nursery. He had lived here, slept here, for many days before his mother had grown with child and he and Cersei had been gently moved to rooms closer to their parent's.\n",
      "When Mother had caught Cersei touching him, he had been moved much closer to the nursery again, far away from his sister.\n",
      "\"Let me see Jaime,\" said Cersei, eagerly, green eyes, a slight shade darker then his own, bright.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaime had been mildly confused but saw no harm in lifting his shift over his head. Cersei had done the same. Jaime thought that they looked just the same if had not been for Cersei's slightly longer hair, and the fact that she looked different down there. It reminded him of a cowrie shell he had found on the beach and he wondered why she did not look like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's funny,\"Cersei had said, hands reaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had grabbed him, forcefully and he had winced. When she began to pet him, Jaime had frowned, and shifted away, only for Cersei to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Touch me too Jaime. See how different we are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaime had not, only stared at his sister, feeling strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cersei, sweetling, have you seen your brother he's not in his-\" Mother said, and she gasped, their daily drought that made his throat itch, falling from her hands in all mighty crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "The glass and tonic ruined Mother's dress, red and simple. And she had stared. And stared. And Jaime had pulled away from his sister, automatically huddling in the way she was staring at them. Cersei had looked at mother, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look at how funny he looks Mother! Jaime let me show mother!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had reached again and Jaime had jumped back. Cersei had cried out when Mother had slapped her, not hard, but enough to snap her head forcefully to the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get dressed. Both of you. Now,\" Mother's voice was as soft as a song, sweet and warm. Her voice then was hard and cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaime, crying had put on his shift. When his Mother reached for him, he had thought she would hit him too. She did not, only scooped him up and called the guards, telling them to stay outside of Cersei's room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you do that often?\" his mother had asked, face tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaime had only cried, not knowing what was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jaime, answer me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaime had only nodded and cried into his mother's neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must never happen again, sweetling. Never again.\"\n",
      "Just like before, he made his way to the elegant, elaborate crib. And just like before, Tyrion, his younger brother was asleep, and Areli, his youngest sister was awake. He felt, vaguely, cheated that he hadn't gotten to name them, but liked their new names anyway. Areli gurgled a greeting, softly, voice sweet and high. Her soft eyes squinted at him, before relaxing and she moved one of her hands in a way that looked like she was waving. Mother had said that it would take almost a year before babies could really understand and that they were too busy growing to pay attention to people, but the wave warmed Jaime's heart anyway.\n",
      "\"Hello again,\" he whispered, beaming.\n",
      "She murmured, softly, gently, in a sweet way that had his smile widening.\n",
      "Hesitantly, he placed a hand in her pale hair, like starlight, threading it through his fingertips, marveling at how soft the fluff on her head. It was slightly different from Tyrion's hair, which was pale gold, paler than his own, but it looked like Uncle Tygrett's hair. Areli's hair was growing long, coming to rest across her shoulders in tight curls, much like his and Cersei's. No one had bothered to cut it, in the coming moons since Mother had died. Her eyes are clear, blue things, looked at him, carefully. He wondered at them, remembering that his mother had mentioned that babe's eyes change, and hoping he could see it happen in his sister and brother.\n",
      "\"I thought babies were supposed to sleep more… Mother said you couldn't play very much when you were born because of it.\"\n",
      "The baby gurgled and moved her little shoulders. Had she not been a baby, Jamie would have thought she shrugged. She reached out, little face scrunched up in focus before she grabbed the hand he had on her head. She pulled it to her, and for a moment he thought that he would suck on his fingers, as Cersei liked to do, but the baby only placed it on her face and leaned into it. She hummed, softly, and Jaime felt his smile widen yet again at the small smile on her pale face.\n",
      "\"Do… Do you want to play?\" he asked, after a moment, wondering.\n",
      "The baby's eyes slowly opened. Her brows furrowed again, before she just watched him, without answering. He smiled, and slowly reached out to grab her out of the crib. Areli made a noise, not of protest, but of warning. Jaime blinked before he smiled at her.\n",
      "\"Let's play, Areli,\" he said, excitedly.\n",
      "The baby was stiff as he went to lift her out of the crib, but, just as his Mother had made him and Cersei practice on a doll, he made sure to hold her head carefully. With that, the baby relaxed, tiny arms going around his neck and she huffed as he slowly made his way out of the crib. The baby was heavier then he would have thought considering her size, but she was so warm. She shivered against him, so he grabbed a blanket from the crib, a woolen thing he had seen his mother knit herself, before absently petting Tyrion as he passed. His younger brother hardly moved, only snorted softly, as curled deeper into his plush bedding. Jaime made his way, slowly over to the low burning fire, humming. He spread out the blanket, and carefully laid Areli across from it. Then he added another log, carefully, like Uncle Kevan had shown him how to do it.\n",
      "\"Mother always said to let sleeping babies sleep,\" he said, wisely, wagging his finger at his younger sister, \"So I can only play with you, for now, Areli. I know how much it hurts to be separated from your twin. Cersei says it hurts here.\"\n",
      "He gestured to his chest, tightening tightly across his sleeping shift, scrunching up the cotton material in his fists. He let his fist relax.\n",
      "\"So I'm sorry. But you're with me!\" he said, smiling brightly.\n",
      "The baby had looked at him. Before she had laughed.\n",
      "Laughed for him, sweet and high, an impossibly nice thing that made his eyes prickle. Mother was gone... But Tyrion and Areli were here.\n",
      "\"Let's play, sister!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "OOOOOOOOOOOOO\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli watched as Jaime fell asleep, finally, around her, head curled absently into her stomach. His hair, a golden blond, was in ringlet curls, soft to the touch and very well cared for. Trying to entertain a four-year-old with a body of a few months was exhausting, but filled Areli with a warmth as she watched the innocence play across his beautiful features. Watched at the sheer simple delight he got in trying to play peek-a-boo, trying to get her to crawl with him, making little-roaring noises, claiming to be a lion out on the hunt. She could only laugh and smile at it, at the way he held himself, as he bounced about on hands and knees to play with his younger sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am right where I am supposed to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, by the Seven,\" muttered a voice, and with half-lidded eyes, blurred, Areli listened as the Maester sighed, \"Lord Kevan, call off the search, I've found him.\"\n",
      "\"Oh thank the Mother,\" muttered a foreign voice, coming into the Nursery, \"Oh. Oh. My is that not a sweet image… Tywin is going to be furious that Jaime disappeared like that, no matter how innocent his intentions are. Isn't this the second time he's run off to find his siblings?\"\n",
      "\"I imagine, my Lord,\" said the Maester, sighing again, \"And yes. Lord Jaime has been most insistent on seeing his siblings… If it were not for the fuss that Cersei made this morning, I imagine no one would have been the wiser for it.\"\n",
      "\"How many lessons has the lad miss today?\"\n",
      "\"Two. But as his teacher, I feel the excuse is justified, though I do not think your brother would agree with me.\"\n",
      "The man, Kevan, hummed.\n",
      "\"No, no he would not… So, Tywin told me the babes would live?\"\n",
      "\"Indeed, my Lord.\"\n",
      "\"I am thankful for that. I could not even come to them, for fear of seeing Tywin's and Joanna's children die. I am a craven, but I am brave enough to admit it. Go on and tell my Lord Lannister that his son has been found.\"\n",
      "Footsteps, soft on what she had discovered is smooth, polished stone, come to closer, and she is surprised by the way the man, brother to Tywin Lannister comes and kneels next to her and Jaime. He reached for her, and carefully pulled her into the crook of his arm, gently cradling Jaime's head so it wouldn't slam against the stone, making his head fall into his lap.\n",
      "\"Hello, little lion cubs,\" he said with warmth, \"So sorry I have not come sooner, little Areli. Look at you. So small.\"\n",
      "Areli stared at him, cataloging the differences between this warm, slightly broader man than her biological father. She wonders.\n",

      "EDIT: 16 December 2019\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli III\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She was back at Winterfell's Godswood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She understood before she could even open her eyes. She felt it. If she were to be poetic, it was something deep in her heart, a certainty that felt supernatural that she was within the home of the Old gods of this world, on the property of the family that her own would tare apart if not for her existence. How much history have I changed by merely existing? She opened her eyes, clear, nearly but not quite up to par to her twenty/twenty vision that had greeted her the first time she had awoke here in her dreams. But it was well within normal infant development, as far as she knew. It had never been her jam, children, and when deciding her career as a nurse, she had with little thought or remorse crossed off both prenatal and pediatrics. It wasn't as if as Ana she had hated children- she does not think she ever could find it in herself to truly hate anyone, let alone an entire age group. She was a quick fuse but burned out much too quickly to ever feel a true grudge. In this life, though she understood she was literally a different person, she also did not think she would change either. But children were always so... Strange to her. Foreign and sometimes unsettling in how innocent they were. So, she did not know much about child development more than the most basic and vague knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But her eyes were strengthing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As Areli, she was growing, her body, slowly, so agonizingly slowly, catching up to her mental capacity. The lofty and far distant goal of full automation was far off, but closer than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With her stronger, more mature eyes, she could see the sunlight filtering through venous red leaves. She was cradled by the roots of the wirewood, starched bones, on a bed of those red leaves. She is cradled in bones and blood… She can feel eyes, so many, watching her from the branches she vaguely sees in the distance. She is not alone, but she feels no comfort in that thought. Because Magic and Monsters are real and within her reach. Waiting for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She blinked, closed her eyes with the panic clawing at her throat. She cannot even cry or whimper, too aware of the things that watch her. Waiting for her weakness to claw and tare-\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Areli,\" said Joanna Lannister, warmly.\n",
      "Areli's eyes open. Joanna is next to her, face soft and facing her. Since she was so close, her face was vividly clear, and so  young , barely in her early twenties. Areli said nothing back, not even a coo. Joanna only sighed, hand reaching out to lay on her head, threading slim, soft fingertips through her fine hair. She smiled and it is as beautiful as a sunrise, just as brilliant and warm. Areli sighed as well. It is a huff of air, it blew away Joanna's blonde hair, flyaway strands falling into her smiling face. It showed, how… Human this ethereal woman is. Because her beauty is marred by that movement, by that frustration on Areli's part.\n",
      "\"I know sweetling. I am sorry to take away your false hope. But no daughter of mine will ever be in denial over themselves,\" she murmured, green eyes intent, \"Least of all you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She said this every time. She always is adamant that Areli could not deny herself. It made the part of her that mourned the loss of being Ana the most want to scream, claw and at those leaf green eyes. But she doesn't. For one, she can't, for another, she didn't like the thought of violence. Her anger was misplaced anyway. She wasn't angry at Joanna, not really. She just angry at the situation. She was angry at death and loss, and while understanding this did little to soothe her violent emotions, it at least helped her not temper them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why… Why do I dream of you?\" Her voice is sweet and clumsily. But it isn't the voice of an infant. Instead of a child or a young woman, it is ever shifting. Ever inconsistent between the two. Some of her words are an echo of the two voices, of her voice as Ana and something of what her voice would be of Areli. The dream is her world, she supposed and her communication skills were more on par on what she was mentally. Not quite a child, not quite an adult, somewhere in the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "And she had dreamed of Joanna, every night, always in the Godswood. The woman, more often than not, did not speak to her, only held her and sang lullabies. Areli on her part had refused to speak at all, even if the knowledge of the possibility had been hanging in the back of her mind. Now… Now she cannot help it. She… She was so tired of silence in her waking moments. Of being able to talk to someone who wasn't a babbling baby. She does not know if she can handle it in her dreams either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jonna hummed, again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish to see you.\"\n",
      "\"Do…. Do you try to see them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She wondered. Joanna cannot be attached to her surely, as much as she was to her husband or her two eldest children. Part of Areli denied, despite everything, that she was this woman's child. But part of her is already reluctantly accepting. I am right where I'm supposed to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your father is too pragmatic, too narrow to open his mind. He is so logical, he would not let me in And I do believe to dream of me would hurt him if he ever accepted me into them. Cersei is much the same. Jaime… Jaime cannot linger with the memory of me. He is so sensitive a child.\"\n",
      "\"And Tyrion?\"\n",
      "\"I will haunt his life. I cannot haunt his dreams. He is too young.\"\n",
      "\"What of my dreams, Joanna Lannister? If I am your daughter as you claim, then I too, am too young to be haunted by you.\"\n",
      "\"You have felt death. Perhaps that is why I feel as if I must see you. You understand me.\" confessed the young woman, \"And you are mine, Areli. My babe. If I can see one of you, it delights me that it is you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears slip down her sharp cheekbones, from her beautiful eyes. Hands reach, thread through her limbs, lifting her, pressing her to her breasts to nestle between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I love you, my Areli.\"\n",
      "\"... I'm sorry. I know you want comfort. But I just died myself. I don't think I can give you what you want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a struggle. She couldn't deny that. The woman in front of her was mourning as much as her. And she wasn't reborn. She wanted to hate Joanna. Wanted to hate her as she came to her, every night, singing and love and sorrow about her. She clung to Areli. She sang to her, loved her, and Areli wanted nothing more to be far away from this ghost in her dreams. But Joanna would not let her go, a mystical connection between the two that Areli could not understand or feel comfortable with.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The guilt of the woman's death haunted her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The love she gave she gave so freely choked her and locked her into the understanding of being someone  new.  To discard Ana Marino.\n",
      "But she was not so sure she could  discard  who she had been. If she had too, what was the point of remembering who she had been? If she must what was the point of being Ana at all?\n",
      "\"I know, sweetling. I know. I will allow you to mourn, to understand your new life. But remember-\"\n",
      "\"I am right where I belong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. And they will Hear You Roar, my little lioness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "OOOOOOOO\n",
      "Areli woke.\n",
      "It is quick, her eyes flying open and her young heart is pounding. She licked her lips clumsily, blinking rapidly. She had not meant to go to sleep, but her infant body has its own rhythm that no mental capacity can control. She fell asleep at a drop of a hat, and every time she closed her eyes she sees Joanna in the Godswood, waiting for her. Longing to speak and sing and love her.\n",
      "She sighed. Exhausted, in both body and mind, and in her heart.\n",
      "\"Hello again, young ones,\" and that's the Maester, briefly, she wonders if anyone will ever say his name so she can learn it, \"How do you two fair as of today?\"\n",
      "So far, this older man is one of the few constants in her new life. Beyond her fellow twin, and Jaime, and the wet nurse, he always came, like clock-work, to inquire or check on them. Every few hours, every day. Her biological Uncle, Kevan tries, but he is more or less in charge of the castle- Casterly Rock is no easy thing to run she is sure, and he has his hands full. At most, he can see them once a week, if that. She has never seen Tywin again, as he is in King's Landing more often than not as Hand of the King and Cersei is just as absent. Gentle hands descend on her twin, carefully checking his frightfully small limbs, cradling his larger than normal head, checking his pulse and breathing. He worked carefully and delicately, humming as he did. She noted, with a small amount of hope, that perhaps this world is far more gentle than what she expects. She usually squashed down that hope rapidly because while it does great things for her morale, she has always been a realist. The world is a harsh one, and she did not want to place herself in a position of ignorance and hope. She did not want to die so early in this new life, despite how much everything is already stacked against her.\n",
      "She still remembered the look on her Tywin's face, after all. The man, grief-stricken, did not look as if he wished to show her or her twin any care.\n",
      "\"Well, young Master Tyrion,\" said the Maester with a slight cheer, \"You seem to be completely healthy if a sore because of the stiffness of your limbs.\"\n",
      "The old man proceeded to massage the boy's tiny, shorter than average arms and legs. He does it for stimulation and stiffness of the poor underdeveloped muscles. Areli gurgled, gently, in approval. The Maester looked at her, a small smile quirking on his lips.\n",
      "\"Happy little thing, are you not?\" he murmured, in faint approval, \"Hardly cry, don't you sweetling?\"\n",
      "She gurgled in answer, not even bothering to try and form words in front of him. She had a couple of months, logically, until any form of language would be acceptable. She's using Tyrion as a measuring stick, and while she planned on improving her mobility and language skills, she's not going to show her cards without Tyrion getting there first. She doesn't see the point of doing so, and she really doesn't want more attention on herself beyond necessary. She thanks whoever is listening that Tyrion is intelligent, as that means she has less time to be confined to baby actions.\n",
      "\"Your mother would have loved you both.\"\n",
      "She blinked, surprised and turned away, her mind on newborn leaves as eyes and a gentle kisses to the temple, of cradling limbs of both flesh and bone and bleeding trees.\n",
      "She needs not the Maester's comfort.\n",
      "Her dreams are proof enough.\n",

      "EDIT: 16 December 2019\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli IV\n",
      "\n",
      "Tywin Lannister returned to her life as many people seem to, catching her unawares as she stares bored, above her, her twin asleep and huffing gently against her sensitive skin, a silent comforting presence.\n",
      "At first, she was trying to entertain herself by humming a song beneath her breath. The embers of the fireplace are low and almost gone, the once frequent crackle and pop of the wood are few and far between. She tended to be that, just plain bored when the crushing depression of her situation is not weighing her down. She just tried and tried and tried to keep herself entertained. She did stretches, she did kicks, she sang and hummed alone and tried to form clearer and clearer words. She brushed her hands through Tyrion's hair, she massaged his limbs to help him, made him follow her stretches and kicks, and he usually followed with a cheerful giggle and a happy coo.\n",
      "The man loomed into sight, silent as a spectator and she can only jump as he looked down at her. He is alone this time, silent and green eyes, so dark that they are nearly black in the low light, staring.\n",
      "She can still see grief in him.\n",
      "His face is carefully blank, carefully arranged, stubble was gone to smooth skin and sort of ridiculous mutton chops. His hair is closely cropped, shaved to only a faint fuzz, golden and dark. But beyond that, she can see the heavy lines of lack of sleep beneath his dark eyes, a tightness to the set of his thin mouth, a paleness to his skin, perhaps a lack of elasticity in neglecting his health.\n",
      "She pitied him.\n",
      "She pitied him as she pitied Joanna, the phantom in her dreams. That pity grows, each night as the woman sings and whispers words of love in her ears, underneath the boroughs of blood and leaning against the bone of the heart tree. And she feels so much pity at that moment as the man came to stand next to her shared crib, watching as he does, both for herself and for the man that loomed over her. She would be quite content not to be here, the biological daughter to this man, and he would be happy to have his beautiful wife. If she could, she would gladly swap places, she would gladly be dead wholesale instead. It was much easier to be dead then to have a second chance at life in a world so different from her own. But just, as Joanna told her every time she fell asleep, I am right where I'm supposed to be.\n",
      "\"Do you not sleep?\" he asked her. His voice is deep. It is a smooth bass, and seeped into her bones, lovely and so frigidly cool, \"I swear every time I see you awake, you pale thing.\"\n",
      "She shivered in the warm wool of her crib.\n",
      "His hands come down, carefully, large and deeply calloused, and pulled at the blonde curls of her head. It is an entirely gentle movement, careful not to pull too hard. It's in that gesture that she remembered that he is a father of four very young children. Two of which she bets meet every one of his expectations. She still is frighted of that hand, holding her hair. Because she knew how much pain this man can cause, she knew how frightfully delicate her new body is. She is fragile and so easy to kill.\n",
      "\"All of you is without color. You are a white thing. I can see your veins, blue spidery things across milk-white flesh. You look a corpse.\"\n",
      "He frowned. It is a slight downward tilt of his lips. So slight that she can barely see that pull of his muscles.\n",
      "\"Save your eyes. You… You have her eyes. Already they have turned from the blue of birth to her eyes. It would be much easier if you did not have her eyes.\"\n",
      "Areli blinked.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I have Joanna's eyes… Nice to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You should have died in her stead,\" he whispered it like a secret, the great Lord of Casterly Rock, confessing what seems to be his greatest wish in the dark of the nursery of his home, \"Both if not at least one of you. Joanna should be here, not you. You left her bleeding beyond imagination. I can still smell it in my sleep, the scent of death and blood and how she smiled at both of you even as she slipped away.\"\n",
      "He must think himself really alone, unknowing to his witness bellow him, his youngest biological daughter hearing as he wished for her death. The grisly scene of her birth and Joanna's death. She wished this would stir her anger, her hatred for her vague knowledge of this man… But she understood him, has seen his like in so many people like him from working in the ER. Needing to blame something, anything but fate itself for the loss of someone they loved. She had, in her last life, received all forms of grief from strangers, the hatred for 'not doing enough', the gratitude for trying to save a loved one. She had bared both, had understood both and did not allow those potent emotions to stop her in her work as a nurse that just wanted to help.\n",
      "Tears prickle and she lets them fall. Carefully, ignoring the possible repercussions, she pressed herself into the fist he has made around one of her long curls. She thinks of the song Joanna had sung to her just before she had woken up and she opened her mouth to sing it as well. She doesn't bother with words, she disliked the way they sound clumsy on her still unpracticed tongue and toothless mouth, but rather a wordless imitation of the song.\n",
      "Tywin froze, all muscles stiffening at the sounds coming from her throat.\n",
      "It is clear and high, sweet as birdsong or the chime of bells. Even to Aleri's ears, it sounds… Inhuman, but it is a vague thought. This is the world of Monster and Magic, after all. If she were a more fanciful person, as someone reincarnated she would think she was an example of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unnatural and Magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Joanna adored that song,\" he whispered, and she faltered at the fact that his voice has grown hoarse, \"She would sing it to Jaime and Cersei in their crib. She sang it to me before I began to court her. She… She said it would remove my unpleasant expression.\"\n",
      "Green eyes so dark look at her. Almost pleading.\n",
      "His eyes, cool and assessing, no longer red-rimmed as they had been, but instead were a frighteningly dark green. Jaime's had been as soft as and pale as the new leaves of spring as had Joanna's, but his father's eyes are as full and dark as the fruitful color of summer leaves, sparked with golden flecks. They would have been incredibly beautiful, but the color wasn't the only thing striking in his eyes. They were… Cold now. No longer blazing fury. But rather still, cool, calculation.\n",
      "But as he looked at her she saw something past the cold. Saw a man who had lost his world.\n",
      "Areli opened her mouth again and sang until the Great Lord of Casterly Rock left, just as the light of Dawn came to the nursery.\n",
      "He left as he had come, silently.\n",
      "\n",
      "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a bright, grateful thing. As lovely as anything that Areli has ever seen in either of her lives. And it, despite everything, has something in her heart warming at the sight. Joanna  pressed kisses to Areli's temple, her cheeks, nuzzled her nose against her own smaller one, humming gently a wordless trill of joy. Her pleasure is apparent, her gratefulness even more so. And it seeped into Areli wordlessly and she can only sigh. \n",
      "\"Thank you, sweetling. Your father needs more gentleness then most would think,\" whispered Joanna, and her voice is warm and joyous, as she pressed another kiss to her brow, one that lingered sweetly. \n",
      "\"Must I be the one to give it to him?\" her question is not angry, just soft and tired.\n",
      "She feels so tired, all the time. She felt even in her sleep, she gets no escape. Joanna is always  there.\n",
      "\"Who else is there?\" demanded Joanna, voice still infused with joy.\n",
      "\"He has three other kids.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna gave a soft, lovely laugh. She rocked Areli softly in her arms. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cersei is self-centered. Jaime is too content with what is given and Tyrion wants from Tywin.\"\n",
      "\"So it is left to me, the changeling in your household?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You keep denying yourself, doubting your place. You are Areli Lannister of Casterly Rock. You are-\"\n",
      "\"Right where I am supposed to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A giggle. Sugar sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly! You know the words, now it is only left for you to believe them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli sighed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me time. Just… Give me time. I need that. I deserve that.\"\n",
      "\"My gentle-hearted girl. Use it well. Heal as you wish, but do not forget to touch those who need you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tywin I & Joanna I\n",
      "\n",
      "The babe is asleep in the small transportable cradle he had had commissioned for his elder children, but four years ago. It can house two babes- Joanna had insisted on it, desperate for the need to keep their elder twins together- but at the moment he has the one. She is draped in red silk and golden, fine wool. It made her whiteness all the starker. It highlighted the blueness of her skin, of how much she looked a corpse, against the warm colors of their House. It is only the way her small chest moved, and how her eyes- Joanna's eyes- closed, highlighted how her starlight eyelashes fluttered long and like bird wings, a shade darker then the paleness of her skin. Her lips thin and small, look almost blue trembling in her sleep.\n",
      "\"Tywin, your daughter is missing!\" came a voice, high and distressed.\n",
      "Tywin flickered his gaze to his only sister, Genna Lannister (never a Frey) as she burst into his Solar without knocking or announcement from the guards positioned at the end of the hall. Her cheeks, full and rosy from exertion, are contorted in a frown, her dark green eyes wide with panic. Behind her is Maester Curwin, wheezing, holding onto the Imp. No doubt they has just come from the nursery, a few floors below his Solar. Tywin knew that Genna's assessing eyes had searched for the babes as he had greeted her home last night, just a tick mark after his own arrival. They had been mostly outlying family, preparing for the coming visit of the Princess of Dorne. Genna, with her little pathetic husband by her side, had looked for her newest relations, disapproval had been clear, the furrow in her brows as she had realized the babes were not in the greeting party. His excuse had been their young age, but the reality had been his disgust to show them to anyone. He was the ridicule of the Seven Kingdoms, again, from the birth of the twin monstrosities. Genna had forced cheer to greet her four-year-old niece and nephew, her eyes searching but not scolding. But that had been before.\n",
      "Before his unrest last night had driven him to the nursery.\n",
      "Before he had heard her.\n",
      "\"Do you not knock, upon entering your Lord's solar?\" is his response, calloused hands drifting, calmly making a show of refilling his quil. He tried to ignore that he has yet to touch his correspondence since he had woken up, fetched the girl from the Nursery just mere hours after he had left her. That he had sat idle, just waiting for the girl to wake up.\n",
      "Genna frown deepened, as she pressed a hand to her heaving, enormous bosom, attempting to catch her breath.\n",
      "\"Forgive me. Most uncouth of me,\" she gave a perfect curtsy, golden and rosy hands flickering with her impatience. Behind her Curwin and the guards follow suit into deep bows, \"But we had thought the girl taken!\"\n",
      "Curious eyes look to the mobile crib, her fine brows furrowing.\n",
      "\"Areli is in there, is she not?\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "He does not explain himself. And he would not as was his right as Head of his House.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could I say?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It stands that you have taken the liberty to grab one of the newest of the Great House of Lannister and not the other. And told no one of it.\"\n",
      "Tywin raised a brow of his own, carefully controlled mask still. He does not like the reprime he hears in his exasperated sister's voice.\n",
      "\"They are my children,\" the words are bitter on his tongue, his voice growing colder because of it, \"I saw fit to bring the girl to my Solar. What is there question about that?\"\n",
      "He wrote on fine vellum, hand moving quickly and without flourish into expensive red ink and then across the page. His hand is steady, even if all he wrote were the words to Joanna's song. He dismissed their concern completely to look as if he is in deep concentration.\n",
      "Genna hummed. It is not a happy sound, he can see at the edge of his vision that she has bared her teeth. A growing sign of her anger, of her displeasure.\n",
      "\"I grant you that much my brother. But must you send your house in an uproar?\" her voice, in her irritation, had grown louder, \"We thought the baby GONE!\"\n",
      "Tywin eased his his fine eagle feather quill down, carefully cleaning its nib free of his fine red ink. He even proceeded to sharpen it with the knife he kept at his desk for the very purpose. He closed his inkwell with a deliberate click, the golden maw of the lion snapping ominously into the now silent room.\n",
      "He stood.\n",
      "Genna, realizing her mistake, closed her lips over her exposed teeth. He carefully kept the quill knife in hand. Genna's chin wobbled for a fraction of second before she swallowed thickly and dipped her head in deference.\n",
      "\"My Lord Lannister, my apologies,\" her voice still holds a touch of irritation, but the apology is true.\n",
      "Tywin, as if he never heard her, put away the quill knife. He looked at his sister, the Maester with the Imp in his frail arms. Part of Tywin wishes that he would drop the thing on his fragile head. But he had promised Joanna. He had sworn to her as she lay bleeding in his arms that he would protect their children- all of them- and keep their House prosperous.\n",
      "\"Are you finished?\" he inquired, softly.\n",
      "Genna sighed.\n",
      "\"Tywin.\"\n",
      "\"Well?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, brother.\"\n",
      "\"Good. Do not question me, my Lady.\"\n",
      "Tywin sat, his palms flat on the desk. His gaze flickered to the baby. Something in Tywin's stomach coiled as those starlight lashes flutter, as she macked those lips in drowsy motion. Then those green eyes clear, focus as they open. The pale brows, hard to distinguish from her skin, furrow. He saw her panic, hands plump and showing her health despite the pallor of her skin, searching for her twin. She does not cry, only makes a brief sound of distress before she seemed to swallow the noise forcibly down. He felt his own brow tighten, before carefully reaching out to press his hand on the girl's stomach. She is small. Smaller than Jaime had been, the smaller of the two twins, at her age. So small that her stomach fits the span of his fingertips. At the gesture, the girl stilled. She even stopped breathing.\n",
      "Green eyes look to him.\n",
      "They widen and blink rapidly. Her little breath came in a woosh. He felt her chest expand, through wool and silk. She is still entirely too still. Starlight lashes flutter.\n",
      "\"Tywin?\"\n",
      "He blinked, hand still on the girl, looking toward his sister.\n",
      "\"Are you alright?\"\n",
      "He frowned. And then he feels himself still as small fingertips curl around his. He turned back to the girl. Sees her, hands so different from his golden skin, holding carefully onto his thumb, his forefinger. Those starlight eyelashes flutter and she astounds him by sitting forward. She sits up, much sooner than either Jaime or Cersei, who Joanna had told him had been sitting at seven moons. It has been only five since the girl's birth.\n",
      "\"She's sitting!\"\n",
      "The girl is looking at him. Her mouth pulled into a frown. He stared back, intensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sing. Sing again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tywin is nothing but control. But he wishes to hear the song again, in that voice. In front of his sister, Maester and guards, he cannot bring himself to ask out loud.\n",
      "\"How amazing-\" Genna faltered. In her enthusiasm, she seemed to forgotten that she already has his ire. His sister, possibly the wisest of his siblings, fell silent.\n",
      "The girl is still just staring at him. Does not make a sound, only breathed, before her gaze flicker to Genna, who had come around his desk to look. Genna stopped. Nearly slips back in her silk slippers. The girl's gaze focused on Genna, her grip tightening on his thumb. Blue tinted lips tremble.\n",
      "\"Hello, sweetling,\" the girl made a noise, almost of protest at the endearment from his sister's mouth.\n",
      "Genna reaches. The girl stared her down. Her hand returned to her side. The hold on his fingers tightens further.\n",
      "\"She has Joanna's eyes… But your gaze, brother.\"\n",
      "He saw it. Never seen such a stern gaze from an infant, then again, he knew few babies. He had been in Royal Court for the majority of the year his first children had been born. He had paid little mind to the young princeling years before, never mind any other babe at Court or within his House.\n",
      "\"So she does.\"\n",
      "It is an acknowledgment. It is hard to articulate the struggle of admitting such a thing, even aloud. To think that she had come from him, as had her monstrous brother. But… The song. Tywin is not a sentimental nor fanciful man. But the sound of… His daughter's voice, singing his wife's song sweetly and in warmth to him. Tywin is also an honest man, especially to himself.\n",
      "And he wished to hear it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\"You seem unsettled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli shifted, cradled in a bed of red leaves. Her blue lips tremble. The eyes that look at her are her own, a legacy Joanna is pleased to see, given to her youngest daughter and her eldest son. They look at her with confliction in them, with the unease of what has just transpired, of where Areli had fallen asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna Lannister smiled, knowing and humming beneath her breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He isn't supposed to be this way,\" is Areli's small protest, in her gentle voice, sweet as honey, soft and confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna smiled, brilliantly at the confusion on her daughter's part. She knows that Areli is a gentle soul. She had, upon seeing her vestige of her past life, seen that she also had knowledge if vague of the goings-on of Westeros. Of what the Great House of the West, of what the name Lannister meant. Especially when it came to her husband's more brutal tactics. But she supposes it was a shallow knowledge… Or a highly moralistic one. She sees it, in her daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The morality of a gentle world that new little strife and struggle on the scale of Westeros.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She sees her good heart and goodwill, the brilliance and frankly the purity of her kindness and compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna adored her for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli will be good and gentle, will be kind and loved by all who knew of her. But she also knew her daughter was swayed by her kind emotions, more so than any noblewoman should. It was a dangerous temperament, especially as a daughter of Tywin Lannister. She was, at best, in danger of being taken advantage of, and at worst a weak link. Joanna, realized, very early in their strange relationship, that Areli was much too similar to herself. Only Joanna had learned to temper her kinder impulses, learned at the feet of princesses within the Royal Court the intrigue and dangers that came with being a noblewoman.  And Tywin…\n",
      "\n",
      "Tywin had been Joanna's balance, much as she had been his.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband had been her opposite, hard and brutal, and together they had balanced each other. She had been Tywin's temperance. Tywin had been Joanna's temperance. They had balanced the other and together had made a powerful couple. And more importantly, been madly, wildly in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli would find her balance, hopefully in a good match, if perhaps in a friend. She would also have to learn. She was a lioness of the Rock. She was a Lannister. The glory of the House, the greatness and power they held… Areli would learn and she would be  glorious . Joanna felt it, understood that in death what her daughter would bring in her wake, even if she did not know the specifics. Her gentleness would perhaps hinder her, or give her a new perspective, but it would not paralyze her. Or have her deny her duty to her House, to her  family . Tywin would make sure of it, if only for the sake of the house and perhaps, if Areli was able to sway him as Joanna once had, for Areli's sake. She hoped Areli would, not replace her, but rather sway her father in ways similar enough as she had in life. She did not think that Cersei, Jaime, nor Tyrion were capable of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But this girl, this baby? I think she will be what my husband needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what did you expect of him?\" she asked her youngest.\n",
      "\"Not this. It's hard to gather fury and disgust in the wake of suffering.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna hummed, fingertips sliding through thick curls, pale and fine. Areli leaned into it. As indifferent as she tries to act, she knew her daughter was not immune to her love and affection. It heartened her, gave Joanna the strength to return to her youngest's dreams. She, touched by the Stranger, bound to Joanna because of it, could not deny, at least on a subconscious level that they were truly mother and daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You want monsters and villains. And believe Tywin to be the best candidate for it.\"\n",
      "\"Yes. But it's more than that. I know what he's capable of. I know how he will treat his children-\"\n",
      "\"You seem to forget that you are his daughter. You also seem to forget that you really do not know the man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pale brows furrow, and green eyes narrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess I don't-\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna smiled, sharply. She saw weakness. She saw hesitation. And she pounced upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Learn sweetling. Learn to know my husband, your father. He is not as monstrous as you think him.\"\n",
      "He could be. Joanna is no fool and the strings of the  Rains of Castamere  had never failed to unsettle her. But Joanna believed that all men had the capacity. Her husband was ruthless, ruled with fear and might. But she loved him. Loved the rare moments where the Great Lord of Casterly Rock had fallen away to show a young man burdened by the legacy of Kings and fools.\n",
      "\"How could you love him?\" is her daughter's reply.\n",
      "\"He is a great man.\"\n",
      "And he was. But it had always, always been more than that. He had  chosen  Joanna. A great man would have found a better match then a distant cousin from a minor branch of his own house. Should have done so. She remembered urging him to not be the fool, something he had never suffered well, and his stubborn refusal of her rejection:\n",
      "\"Choose more wisely my lord, for your bride. I am not enough to be the next Lady of the West, thought heartened as I am by your offer. You know your duty is to marry well, bring in influence from another Great House-\" she pleaded, even as her heart is beating so fast that it felt as if Joanna could not breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Years, of Tywin, looking her way, speaking to her, and she had expected his flirtations, his attention to stop. To stop once he realized she would not lose her maiden-head to anyone but her Lord-Husband, and that he would have to sait his lust with anyone but her. She had taken his courtship, swearing to herself that she would harden her heart to her Casterly Rock cousin, but... Oh, she had failed. Princess Meria had been correct in telling her that she was in great danger of losing herself to Tywin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was why she had to let him go. It was why she refused him. She knew him. Knew what he wanted- esteem, praise- and he would not achieve it marrying her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What greater House is there other than my own?\" he said back to her, a flush on his handsome face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna's heart wavered, bloomed in the wake of his dark eyes staring at her so intensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your father would never allow it,\" she countered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tywin openly scoffed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father is a fool that only cares for his whore and his wine.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot marry you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tywin stared for a moment, his jaw working furiously. Boldly, more boldly than he has ever dared before, he came to sit next to her, eyes intent as he gripped her hand in his. His hand was frightfully large in comparison to her's, but when he held her hand it was so delicately, so softly that it warmed Joanna, who knew how strong he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cannot or will not?\" he asked, and now his voice is softer, as he looked at her with those great emerald eyes solely looking at her.\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\"I am not worthy of you, Lady Joanna?\" he asked, voice still soft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna felt her heart constrict. When did I start loving you?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course! I am not worthy of you-\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled. The Great Heir of Casterly Rock smiled as brilliantly and as handsomely as the Warrior and reached for her other hand, gripped them both in his as if she was the Maiden herself come to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I deem you to be. I deem you to be more than worthy. Marry me, Joanna. Marry me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heart in her throat, Joanna could not help the helpless, breathless \"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her daughter let out a scoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That does not make him a good one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna hummed. Her daughter was a wise soul. But she was new to this world and needed to see the merit of family, especially her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps not. But that is not for you to decide just now, sweetling. Perhaps it would be wise to learn him yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know of no way of judging the future but by the past.\"\n",
      "\"Words, by no doubt someone very wise,\" said Joanna, raising a brow, \"But you do not know the past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli laughed. It is a musical sound. Joanna laughed with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose I don't.\"\n",
      "\"Then be patient, my little lioness. Be patient and learn. And remember-\"\n",
      "\"I am right where I'm supposed to be.\"\n",

      "Notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: 16 December 2019\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaime II & Areli V\n",
      "\n",
      "Cersei was frowning.\n",
      "It was a face that Jaime knew was what Cersei simply did by default. Her face settled into a frown when she was bored, when she was displeased when she was mad and most other emotions. It had become more and more regular when their Mother died. Jaime tried his best, really, to take that face away. He tried his best to make her happier, take away that frown she wore so badly. Because no matter how often she wore a frown, to Jaime it looked bad on her pretty face. It looked the best when she smiled when she laughed when she was happy.\n",
      "So he switched lessons with her, making sure to pick the days he had sword practice, every once and a while because she wanted to learn as well until Mother had forbade it. Made sure to pass her favorite tarts when they broke their fast, made sure to play dolls, Princess and Knights, with her even if he rather play Lion on the Savannah, even if he rather sneak away to play down in the kennels with some of the servant boys. He was proud that it was him that got her to smile, that it was him that got her to laugh. It wasn't often, it wasn't as much as he'd like, but Jaime was the one that made Cersei stop being sad, if only for a moment.\n",
      "But now, at that moment, his eldest sister, his beloved twin, was decidedly not smiling.\n",
      "She was frowning, instead. A great big frown that was directed to the guard standing in front of them, her small arms crossed. It pulled at her pretty face, made her large emerald eyes, look larger. If it had been directed at Jaime, Jaime would have let Cersei pass. Let her pass the second her face had shifted from quiet demand to visible upfront, to being visibly offended. It was easier really, to let Cersei have her way in certain things. She was stubborn to a fault, his twin, and would be rather mean when she didn't get what she wanted. And at that moment, she wasn't getting what she wanted.\n",
      "But the Guard was having none of it.\n",
      "\"Lord Lannister was not to be disturbed, my Lady,\" said the guard, sternly. He said it in such a way that few people dared to talk to his eldest sister, firm, repriming to the little Lady of the Casterly Rock, \"He and Lord Kevan are preparing for the arrival of the Princess of Dorne-\"\n",
      "Septa Dianne gives a pleasant smile, gripping Cersei's shoulder with a gnarled hand, curled over the delicate curve of her shoulder. His eldest sister tried to shove it off, but the Septa paid her no mind. She only held tighter and her other hand came to hold the other shoulder. Jaime saw how the slightly yellow nails dug into the red velvet of her gown, pressing against the small rubies that ran along the bodice and sleeves, stark against the gold thread of their mother's fine embroidery.\n",
      "\"And we understand that well, Sir, but Lady Cersei is in need to see her father. She is most insistent.\"\n",
      "\"Be it that Septa, my instructions are firm. I am only to let the Lady Frey pass, and that is only if she brings an emergency that is pressing. Lady Cersei wishing to see her father is not urgent, nor an emergency.\"\n",
      "The Septa Dianne gave a sigh, before she nodded her head, carefully.\n",
      "\"Very well. Thank you for your explanation. Come along Lady Cersei, Lord Jaime-\"\n",
      "\"She's in there! She's always there!\" cried Cersei, tears coming to her beautiful green eyes. At that sight, most servants would have been scared out of their wits, for Cersei's tantrums were legendary in breaking expensive objects, and would have stepped aside, but this man only frowned, as the tears fell down like crystals, winking in the morning light, \"She's in with father, the little monster that killed mother!\"\n",
      "Jaime frowned then, tears coming to his own eyes in frustration. Because this has been a fight that has lasted for moons.\n",
      "\"She didn't kill Mother!\"\n",
      "He was sick of her repeating that every time he tried to get her to visit their younger sister and brother.\n",
      "\"The monster did! And now she's with father, unlike the imp down in the Nursery- She could kill him next!\"\n",
      "\"Don't call her a monster or him an imp!\"\n",
      "\"Don't defend them, they killed mother!\"\n",
      "Jaime felt his stomach twist, heart pounding at the ugly, hard look on his pretty sister's face.\n",
      "\"Don't say that! We're the older siblings we are supposed to protect them and defend them-\"\n",
      "\"Those things are not my siblings!\"\n",
      "\"Enough,\" came the voice of the Septa, voice sharp, \"Lord Jaime, you must return to your lessons, Lady Cersei, we shall do the same.\"\n",
      "\"I'm not leaving until I see father!\" came the cry, and with that, shaking off the Septa's hands with a loud slap, Cersei dropped to the floor.\n",
      "Her large, red skirt flared out around her, she set her jaw and cried pretty tears, crossing her arms. She was shaking her head, rapidly in her evident displeasure. Her face was red and her teeth were bared, like a lioness, her blond curls bouncing at every firm shake of her head. Not looking away from the guard who shifted uneasily as the small girl glared at him. But he did not move, only looked uncomfortable at the display that his sister was making.\n",
      "The Septa who was frowning at her charge, looked over to guard again, her jaw setting.\n",
      "\"Ser,\" intoned the old woman, calmly, \"Forgive me for such a display.\"\n",
      "Then without so much as a nod from the guard, the old Septa reached down and picked Cersei up by the armpits, who started to howl the second she left the ground. The Septa only threw the girl over her shoulder. Nervously, Jaime followed behind them both, intent on returning to the Maester for his own lessons.\n",
      "Through it all, the door that leads to their father's solar, did not move, did not even creak open from the noise being made from his screaming, protesting sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "OOOOOOOOOO\n",
      "\n",
      "Areli thinks, that quite on accident, she has broken Tywin Lannister.\n",
      "For a man that was said to have neglected his children, he spent an awful lot of time with his youngest girl, and Areli was positive that was not normal behavior from the Lannister Patriarch. For all she knew of him, which she had admitted was not much in light of watching a television show, she knew that this was not typical at all. She has noticed this, because every day, for the next two weeks after her dream of Joanna asking her to be kinder to him, without fail, this man, came into the joint Nursery, lifted her with infinite gentleness that was at odds in his cool expression, and placed her securely into the portable cradle.\n",
      "Pointedly, he does not even spare a glance to poor little Tyrion.\n",
      "This always distressed her, and she always reached for her biological twin, a silent plea but of course, he ignored her. He, instead, he made a careful production of tucking her in, movements stern, mechanical, but through in placing her body into the very plush bedding, of keeping her warm and secure. Of just so placing a fine, infinitely warm wool, then a cooler silk blanket across her small body. It is a stern motion because he does not do that thing that parents do. That small opportunity to dote upon their small child. He does not coo at her, does not grasp at her small limbs, her small hands, and feet with quiet adoration. Does not make faces in an attempt at play or to make her laugh, as she had seen many parents do as Ana.\n",
      "But he does take her with him, does take her to what she suspects is his office, does place her to his right, within view, and in front of him. Never out of his line of sight. Despite the fact that he ignored her, intent on what seems to be mountains -god does she emphasis at the sheer amount of paper he seems to go through- of paperwork or correspondence that is necessary for the man of the house- or well, the man of the castle. All-day, vaguely bored and tired as was the norm for a baby, she slept, she played with her hands or with the pillows of her cradle, or with the small dangling objects(Soft cut crystal, and rubies) are above her that is built into the cradle. She hums and sings to herself in wordless song, strengthening her vocal cords best she can.\n",
      "She has nothing much to do, that much hasn't changed since the Great Lord of Casterly Rock had decided to obsessively bring his youngest biological child with him everywhere. He does not pay her much attention, despite carting her back and forth with him. He does not frequently look up in her direction, does not even seem to keep her in mind, behind a few looks here and there. Then only time he seemed to pay her any attention was when he fed her, by his own hand, as in past few weeks she had been forcibly weaned by his command. Her main meals now were some sort of a paste with what she thinks is mostly mixed milk and oats, and boiled fruits or vegetables mashed to make them soft.\n",
      "He never lets anyone touch her as soon as the wet-nurse was no longer needed for her, even to her eternal shame, changing her from when she soils herself, the careful baths in a small bucket he had brought into his office, always just the right type of warm. He does not shower her with affection or praise, hardly says a word, but the fact that he is insistent on having her with him, does so much of the personal child-care, makes her know.\n",
      "She knew it's odd, knew it was wrong because of something she did in particular, rather instead of her misunderstanding the character she remembers from the television show.\n",
      "She knew that it was wrong.\n",
      "That this is not what Tywin should be doing. Not for weeks. Not even for a single day. She knew that as much as she knew that the fourth Lannister child is non-existent. Not real, a part of her stubbornly whispers, just all fake. She knew it as sure as she is by the fact that this is a gesture that is only paid to her, felt it in the glaring absence of her twin beside her. In the large, Tyrion shaped space that the large crib meant for two had beside her. In the fact that since his attention to her, she has not heard a word nor seen the two elder Lannister children. But he has made it a daily ritual, a daily occurrence to take his youngest biological child everywhere with him.\n",
      "The only thing she can conclude that she has accidentally broken him.\n",
      "She touched something in this frightful, terrifying man, and seems to have attention from him because of it.\n",
      "What do you need from me? What do you want? Is Moth-Joanna right in the sense that I need to learn who you are? That you are much more human than I want to acknowledge? Aren't you a monster?\n",
      "\"With all that has happened, perhaps we can persuade the Princess to pay her visit in a year's time,\" said her biological Uncle, Kevan, says, voice gruff, running a hand through his thick, flowing curls. His eyes are red, but focused, on the paper in front of him, ink stains across his tan skin, \"The Keep is ready, and Genna has stepped up into the role of the Lady, but-\"\n",
      "Her biological father, almost, but not quite, rolled his eyes. It as if he wished too, but all he does is sets his jaw. A compromise.\n",
      "\"We will show strength, Kevan, that is what we planned. The Princess is set to arrive within the day. Do you intended to send her back from the harbor?\" his voice is careful distaste, and he does not look up from the parchment in front of him.\n",
      "\"With Joanna-\"\n",
      "\"Do not,\" he said, calm, and icy, \"Do not imply that I am incapable of running a diplomatic visit. Joanna would not have wanted any pause in our plans, and neither do I. I have done my mourning of so many moons. We cannot push this back any longer, and the King is impatient to have me return to King's Landing, at most we have three moons before I have to leave, and I know not when I will be able to return. If you feel comfortable enough, the Princess and her two younger children can return within a year to Dorne. Perhaps I can see them depart myself if the King allows me.\"\n",
      "\"Bugger the King! Step down from being the Hand. Casterly Rock needs you,\" the man gives his brother a fierce look, throwing his parchment down with a slam of his hand across the desk, it is such a loud noise that it startled her, making her remove the gem in her hand, and lean forward to look a the older men, \"You have four young children that are not suitable for the court, that need a parent. They need you, Tywin.\"\n",
      "\"Are you a fool? Are you not enough to be my Steward? Has the Rock been too much responsibility? What would you have me do, leave it in the hands of Gerion or Tygett or perhaps some lesser cousin that is even less competent?! The Houses of Westeros will laugh if I resign as the Hand, they will think us too weak in the absence of my wife, and I for one will not belittle her memory for the sake of what you think is my comfort.\"\n",
      "\"You are running yourself ragged, trying to hold the realm together, the call you the Uncrowned King! But here in the West Joanna did so much-\"\n",
      "\"Do not say it to me as if I do not know all she did. I am well aware of her absence, Kevan.\"\n",
      "\"Apparently not enough! What in the Seven Hells are you trying to prove-\"\n",
      "\"I am your Lord, if I am to remind you, Kevan, you are to speak to me with respect. You have the Rock to attended to, my esteem of your competency extends that far, but that does not mean you are to dictate my actions.\"\n",
      "\"I will if you act in such a manner that neglect your health. You look horrible!\"\n",
      "Tywin, in Areli's opinion, did look a touch thin, thinner than when she had first seen him, and he had the constant air of… Exhaustion. He hid it with his cool demeanor, with his precise behavior, but apparently, he could not fool his brother.\n",
      "\"I am in perfect health.\"\n",
      "\"For how long? You have four children Tywin, do not make them orphans after they just lost their mother.\"\n",
      "The argument is out of nowhere, alarming to Areli as she shifted forward, wiggling out of her blankets. She is leaning out of the crib at this point, hypnotized as the younger man stood, screaming at the older man as he dismisses his concern. Turning back to the paperwork. When the younger man snatched it out of his hands, physically, there is a shift in the Lord of Casterly Rock. He stood as well, demanding the return of the papers. When he does not get the papers back, there is another shift, and for a second, Areli is sure she is about to be witness to a fist-fight.\n",
      "It is when she placed her palms on the desk and upsets the inkwell that the arguing stops. She scrambled, huffing as she watched the blood red ink spill closer to what she knew where important papers. She lifted the inkwell, holding it tightly between her hands, setting it upright. She then took the papers out the way of the running ink, carefully dragging herself out of the crib, and her fine white little nightgown, through the red ink in her haste. She crawled carefully with her it in her hands, and managed, with the force of her sheer will, to sit up, kneeling on the desk and the spilled ink, papers above her head.\n",
      "\"What did she protect from the ink?\" and that's Kevan, voice astonished.\n",
      "Fuck. Way to act like a baby,  Areli.\n",
      "\"Those are the letters from King's Landing,\" said Tywin, voice, considerably quieter than normal.\n",
      "She looked at him, more than a little unsettled on how he stared back at her, this focused look of complete concentration. She had his attention, she knew it, has known it since he had begun there daily ritual of bringing her to his office. She debated it for a moment, to try and act a little more childishly, throw a paper or two around, but knew that what she is holding is important, and in her actions, at least, she has stopped the argument. Despite how entertaining it had been, any form of conflict has always unsettled her.\n",
      "She held out the papers to Tywin, just to get him to do something other than stare at her.\n",
      "It does not work. He just continued to look at her, until her small arms tire. She brought the papers closer to herself, careful to avoid touching them to her ink-stained dress.\n",
      "\"Tywin?\"\n",
      "The man visibly sagged, a forceful sigh escaping him.\n",
      "\"You usually have more care for your clothing,\" he said, with a slight note of disapproval in his voice.\n",
      "She doesn't respond verbally, only extended the papers again. With a gentleness that was at odds with his frowning face, Tywin took the papers into his hand. He set them aside, away from the puddle, and on his spacious desk, before he looked back at her.\n",
      "\"You will need to be changed… Perhaps bathed to remove the stain from your skin. With your skin, it will be vivid, no doubt.\"\n",
      "She looked down, embarrassed despite herself. The red ink is flowing up the delicate cotton, and she is vaguely reminded of a patient that had come in one afternoon, her white summer dress stained with her blood, a boating accident of the poor girl falling off of the small yacht and against some rocks near the shore. She shivered in the cool air, shaking her head rapidly at the memory, before she looked at the man who had made her, however unintentionally.\n",
      "\"Kevan, tell the guard to send for a servant to clean up this mess, fetch a bath, and some clean clothes for her.\"\n",
      "The other man does just that, before he turned back to them, watching as Tywin carefully lifts her away from the ink, the rich, earthy smell clinging to her as ink dripped onto the table. Her feet stay on the table as he supported her, watching with those emerald eyes as the red ink falls onto the desk. Tywin tsked, and reached into the folds of his strange shirt, pulling out a large handkerchief, embroidered lovingly with a magnificent, roaring lion, before he proceeded to dry her legs with his spare hand. When she is no longer dripping, he removed the dress itself, undoing the soft laces from the back and letting it fall to the desk. She is in nothing but what she suspected is the medieval equivalent of a diaper, it too soaked with the ink. He removed it and cleaned her up again, gentle movements, frowning all the while. She shivered in the drafty room, but the man is already bringing her closer, into his chest.\n",
      "The weird shirt is made of fine velvet, a soft texture beneath her hands as she clung to the material. It is warmer, and he held her close before he grabbed one of her wool blankets, swaddling her in gold. He does this without saying a word, and Areli can only hum in response, a small thank you for his care, even if the actions from this man confuse and distress her.\n",
      "\"Why show so much care for this child?\" asked Kevan, and Areli is cheered by the fact, that even though he is across the room, she can more or less see clearly as his brows pressed together in his confusion.\n",
      "\"She is mine, is she not?\" that is the retort, calm, without inflection.\n",
      "\"So is Tyrion.\"\n",
      "Gentle arms around her tighten. Almost, but not quite painfully.\n",
      "\"He… He is deformed. But… Areli is not.\"\n",
      "Kevan scoffed.\n",
      "\"Look at her skin.\"\n",
      "The hold on her is even tighter, and she barely suppressed the whimper.\n",
      "\"It will darken with age.\"\n",
      "\"Your behavior regarding the child is distressing.\"\n",
      "A low rumble, something a growl comes from Tywin.\n",
      "\"Oh? First, you claim me to be neglecting the Rock as I run the Seven Kingdoms, now you claim my attention to my child to be distressing?\"\n",
      "Kevan frowned.\n",
      "\"Yes. You carry her everywhere.\"\n",
      "\"Do not question-\"\n",
      "\"Tywin, for the Seven's Sake-\"\n",
      "\"Leave. You are obviously agitated from the time spent in the room. Come back when you have cooled your head.\"\n",
      "\"But-\"\n",
      "\"That was a command from your Lord, Kevan.\"\n",
      "The other man hesitated before he gives a formal, stiff bow.\n",
      "\"Of course, Lord Tywin.\"\n",
      "He left with a strange expression on his face. That left her alone with Tywin, clinging to his velvet shirt.\n",
      "\"You are a comfort.\"\n",
      "The confession is in the air, heavy and simple.\n",
      "But to Areli it is an ominous proclamation.\n",

      "\n",
      "EDIT: 16 December 2019\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tywin II & Joanna II\n",
      "\n",
      "The dress is all sorts of ridiculous for a baby that is less than a year old, he knew it, the second he placed it upon the child.\n",
      "She gave him a truly unimpressed look, a frown on her pale, plump lips, and an all-together stern look that was emphasized by her pale brows forced together. Has my gaze indeed. How you would have laughed at such a look, Joanna. It was as if she agreed with him, and all that was missing was for the infant to cross her arms. But she restrained herself, careful of the bell, voluminous structure of the sleeves. She was incredibly careful, not moving in a fuss with the material, almost immobile, as if she too, knew the importance of her clothing. Or perhaps she knows my mood to not make a mess of it.\n",
      "Her green eyes, did, however, follow him, as he went about arranging the gown. It was as if his daughter too, knew how ridiculous such ornamentation was and was displeased with it as a result. Areli, sitting as she is upon his desk, just a few feet away from the stain she had made the night before, looked highly uncomfortable, and altogether dissatisfied. She is remarkably expressive, for such a young child, managing to look annoyed even around the copious roundness of her face.\n",
      "She does not cry, as he had seen Jaime or Cersei do at that age, does not fuss or tug at the material. She just looked displeased, leaning against the cushion as he arranged the fabric of the dress that had once belonged to Joanna, and then Cersei, as infants. He had scoffed at such sentimentality on Joanna's part, having told her that any gown she had wanted made for their children was more appropriate. Something newer. Something more fashionable than a dress two decades out of date. She had laughed at him. Laughed at it him in a way no other person could get away with, a mirthful thing that was as lovely as a song and with no malice:\n",
      "\"It's not about it being frugal, my Lord,\" she said with that smile of hers, it was bright and beautiful, but there was something else there. A kindness that in others he saw as weakness, but in her, he had never seen it as so, \"It's about giving something to my child that had been mine. There's a difference, I believe. You are to give Jaime your sword, or your grand legacy of the Lord of the Rock- My legacy to Cersei will be to give her my dresses, made by my hand or by my mother's. Not quite as grand, I give you, but what else is a Lady to give?\"\n",
      "\"Ridiculous. If you were any other woman, I would suspect this a ploy to ask for a larger budget for cloth or lace,\" he told her, raising a brow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna smiled again, smiled as she always did, something soft and expressive. But there was a sort of tilt to her full lips, a brightness in her green eyes. A mischief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh? If I were any other woman, I believe I would be insulted on the part of my sex.\"\n",
      "\"Suffice, it is, my Lady that you are not any other woman.\"\n",
      "\"You flatter me, my Lord.\"\n",
      "\"I do not such thing. I find my patience for such things to be all but none. I only tell the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna laughed. Musical and full, her cheeks flushing the softest pink across her golden skin…\n",
      "\n",
      "He is pulled from his memories, not on his own volition, but rather instead by his daughter's gentle tug on the fur cuff of his doublet. He blinked, looked down at his daughter, in her finery looking up at him with a furrowed brow. As if she read his mind, she dropped her hand from his cuff, but not after soothing the fur to prevent creasing. Looking curious at the material for a moment, small fingertips caressing the golden fur before she dropped her hand to his hand. Then she went to squeezed his smallest finger. Her hand was warm, and he was surprised by her strength he sensed in her tiny hand. It was strange to see such strength in such a delicate, fragile thing. She looked up at him, with her light eyes, just like her mother's, and smiled.\n",
      "For the first time in many moons, what felt like a decade, Tywin felt a small smile on his face.\n",
      "Green eyes blinked. Her hand lingered on the digit for but a moment, before she dropped it once again to her side, almost primly, settling her hands on the silk of her dress. It is a fine dress, one he admired more without Joanna, sees its merit much clearer, much to his dislike. If I could but tell her I understand now as I didn't then. He carefully smoothed down the impossibly thin golden lace and the red velvet threaded with rubies and garnets, alongside careful embroidery of several fine, roaring, golden lions along the golden dyed fur hem, done by his good-mother so many years ago, retouched by his wife's own hand but a few moons ago, in case their latest child was female. A lady's legacy… Hear me Roar, is that not right Joanna?\n",
      "She looked, like some strange doll, stuffed into the fine dress, so wide, with wool petticoats that made her look like a fine cushion. Tywin gave her a raised brow, pressing down her pale, starlight ringlet curls, careful of arranging her hair back and away from her face. He dare not attempt to braid it, as he had much more practice undoing the more complex braids his wife had favored. How I admired the gold of your hair, Joanna, how I would run it through my fingers and think it the finest spun silk in all existence. He added the matching ribbon, made of the same velvet, golden lace and fur as her dress over her head, tying the ribbon tightly behind her curls, already reaching past her tiny shoulders.\n",
      "Despite his dislike of the pale color, tongues will fly, I have no distrust of you, wife. I would never believe you to be such a fool. Does Tygett not have such pale curls as well, with a few darker strands? He found he could not dare cut the curls and would let them grow to a respectable length. Perhaps to her waist- longer if the child would support it. Joanna had set a fashion in the Royal Court by having it nearly to her knees, always elaborately made in handsome braids that many tried to imitate to a lesser degree. Cersei could not support having such long hair, to Joanna's despair, and frequently had it trimmed to a neat length to her shoulders. He hoped that his younger daughter would emulate her mother. He found his hands lingering in her hair, and the babe took his ridiculousness with ease, simply staring at him.\n",
      "\"You do well to comport yourself,\" he told her seriously before he let his hand drop, smoothing down the last strand of flyaway hair. \n",
      "Now, he cannot help but admired the effect her daughter's look would have on anyone who saw her, and despite the paleness of her skin, she manages to look quite well and an attractive little thing in her Winter finery.\n",
      "The young girl stared at him, still frowning before she placed her hand gently on the ribbon band in her hair. A question, he is sure, for him to take it off. With her expression, he knew that it is what especially bothered her. Tywin doesn't quite tsk at her, but he does make a clicking sound with his tongue to the general air, then he placed one hand on her smaller one, dragging it away from her hair to place it firmly by her side. A silent command that she followed with a slight huff, but no other protest. Her hands settling calmly at her side, making no more motion to undo the ribbon. Intelligent. He cupped her cheek, with a most careful hand. Checking for any remaining stains of the red ink(it had taken several baths to remove it from her skin), moving her head back and forth. He nodded, satisfied.\n",
      "He, like her, is dressed in his best, velvet doublet, lined with fur for the chilly Winter air, red of course, with a little more… Flamboyancy than his typical everyday wear, his facial hair and his hair recently trimmed and shaved. He picked her up, settled her in the crook of his arm, and knew, a few floors below him, the same is being down for his three other children, rounded up by Genna who had volunteered for his children, and would proceed to round up an unruly Gerion. Tygett was already downstairs, there to oversee the preparation for the Harbor and docks, the tent to protect the table of salt and bread for the arrival of the Dornish ship that carried the Princess and her party.\n",
      "\"Pageantry,\" muttered the Lannister Lord, carefully, of the babe as he adjusted his more ornamental sword on his hip, a large, glidden golden lion's head on its pommel, with garnets for eyes, and with diamonds for its fangs, \"A necessary function of wealth. Ridiculous, but we are nothing but prosperous. Our words, Hear me Roar, tell us how we must show the world who we are, Areli. Distasteful, some would say. Wasteful others will say. But we will be spoken about, be seen with awe, envy, and rightful respect regardless.\"\n",
      "He felt all sorts of ridiculous, speaking to her. Or, perhaps, he should feel all sorts of ridiculous. She is barely old enough to sit up by her own accord. But. There is something. Something to saying things to such young a child, to the air around her. She reacted to each word, leaned against him, pressed her small palms and fingertips into his hands, into his velvet coat at the sound of his voice. She appeared to like his voice, always pressing herself into him if he is within reach, small fingertips curling around fingers and fists, around velvet and silk shirts. She liked it. And while she may not comprehend him, she will, and the words will mean more and more to her as she grew.\n",
      "He himself… Appreciated her voice, however rare it is at this point. She mostly hummed, this babe, hummed her moods in soft warbles that caused shivers to go down his spine. Little chirps of melody, soft and strange, compositions complex and unfamiliar. Her singing is what had him bringing her to his Solar in the first place. On occasion, her voice would ring something familiar, the song, one he suspected was sung by Jaime in his escapes to see her and the other child, but it was ever rare an occasion. It was her mannerism, that compelled him to make it a ritual. The way she reacted to him, the way she seemed to reach for him. A comfort, indeed. He could not explain it if he ever were to bother with such idiocy. He explained himself to no one. He had no need, not to anyone but himself.\n",
      "\"I have no care for it myself,\" he told her, truthfully. He found it a bore, thought it ridiculous despite the necessity.\n",
      "The girl hummed as if in agreement, her hand trailed across the embroidered lions on the hem of her dress. She looked up at him, eyes on his face. He looked toward her. Gave her a raised brow.\n",
      "\"But I know its value. It's purpose. Frivolous as it may seem. We are wealth. We are power. We are not just highly ornamental. We are Lannisters. We stand in gold and crimson, in riches of the earth. We are proud and no one's jest.\"\n",
      "Her hands tighten on his shirt, no doubt sensing the shift in his voice. The darkening in tone at the brief remembrance of the mockery of the dunce of his father had made of them. He could almost smile again in that moment. Almost, because he remembered his wife, remembered how she would not demand he 'lighten up', nor that he be content with the recognition he had forcefully brought to their fallen House the second the fool stopped breathing. But instead had always touched his arm in quiet acceptance, and perhaps given it a squeeze if his mood turned too ill.\n",
      "\"We are what we are Areli.\"\n",
      "The girl hummed again, just a touch of a softer sound.\n",
      "He walked the rest of the way out of the Rock in silence, allowing himself to bounce the humming child as he made his way. No one was there to see. He opted to take the outer road to the Harbor, rather than the internal stairs and ramps tunnels below the Keep proper, as there was no doubt there was to be less foot traffic in the open air. Areli proved her gentle temperament again by hardly reacting to the sway of the horse as they made their way to the bottom of the cliffs, to the harbor proper. Even the grand height of a two-thousand and a hundred feet, and the winding slope carved into the rock about as large as one wheel cart wide, barely got a reaction from the babe. She only learned forward curiously, but not alarmingly out of his arms, toward the great vestige of the Sunset Sea in the early morning hours. For the first time, Tywin realized, the girl was seeing the sun and the sea, the first time beneath the sky without the roof of the Rock above her.\n",
      "If he had been a more sentimental man, he would have remarked upon out loud, and despite the fact that he liked to speak to the child who didn't truly understand him-\n",
      "He wasn't sentimental.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least I didn't used to be. Joanna, I suppose your… Absence has left me wanting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the Sunset Sea.\"\n",
      "Areli gave a cheerful gurgle, leaning forward once again. He held her carefully in front of him, making her lean back to press into his lap and chest.\n",
      "\"People say that our mines are our most prosperous aspect- Those people are fools. The mines provide us with gold, of course, but it is the sea and our trade that truly allow us to prosper. From the Lion's Harbor to Lannisport, the Westerlands is a trading hub that is only rivaled by King's Landing.\"\n",
      "The carved road was all but empty, as he calmly explained the intricacy of the sea trade and inner trade in his lands. The only sounds for the hour-long ride is his voice, the gentle hums of his daughter, the sounds of the horse's breath, the breeze of cool air against their skin, and the faint roar of the sea below. He kept the gentlest pace to the opening of the Lion's Harbor. It was, sometimes referred to, infuriatingly as the Lion's Ass (though no one dared in his presence), just as the grand frontal gate that was the only access to the bridge connecting the Rock to the mainland, was called the Lion's Maw.\n",
      "The Lion's Harbor was at the base of the cliff island that housed Casterly Rock, only accessible through the Keep, by the inner tunnels or the widening road, or from the sea. It was an enormous cavern beneath the Rock nearly four-hundred foot high at the highest point and nearly two leagues deep, both natural and half-carved by the holders of the Rock through the centuries. The entrance of it was a nearly clear view of the horizon, wide enough for six larger ships to pass through side by side.\n",
      "Like teeth, enormous iron gates could be lowered in an event of a siege, and Tywin had only seen it done such during the War of Ninepenny Kings, as he increasingly heard it called. Has it already been six years since its end? He remembered how his father had foolishly increased foot traffic during the War, and nearly shut down the sea trade to the Rock proper. It had been a miracle the Rock had not been infiltrated in his incompetence or caused them all to starve. It served as a shipyard to his most impressive ships, about twenty in number, with the other forty stationed in Lannisport. It was lit by so many torches and brazen fire pits, as well as the large entrance that hardly any darkness showed in the half-natural cave.\n",
      "Joanna herself had the tent commissioned to await any delegation that came to their gates or harbor, an enormous thing of the crimson dyed canvas, their sigil and words painted meticulously in the golden dye, emphasized by grand embroidery that was threaded with gold thread. It was as tall as three men, as wide as the arm span of twenty. It was cavernous, stark against the pale gold of the natural rock that Casterly Rock had been built upon. It was made to be a fine sight against the Rock or the Lion's Harbor's walls, to impress and demonstrate the wealth of them. Tywin had approved of the design, had given his wife that rare smile as she demonstrated her rough sketch. He had even allowed her to commission the furniture that was always adorned the tent.\n",
      "Chairs, more thrones then anything, with the seat of the lord being the largest and in the center, as was his right. The table was wide and long, fitting from one end of the tent to the other in a seamless appearance, a deep red-hued wood he had imported from Essos. He noted, that the portable crib that he had left in the nursery had been set on the table amongst platters of fine dried meats, fresh fruits, cheese, wine, and bread. It was empty, save for blankets and what looked like a soft cloth toy that Tywin knew he had not placed there.\n",
      "\"Good morning, my Lord,\" called Tygett, voice calm. He gave a brief if strained smile.\n",
      "\"Ser Tygett,\" he replied. He did not bother with a smile. He was always formal to this brother as if there was any among them that had been found of their father, it was him.\n",
      "Perhaps it was because he was not wise enough to understand what a fool he had been. The dismissal of the Whore had upset the boy, who had seen her as a mother figure. He did not think that Tygett had ever forgiven him, and his prominent position as Hand of the King left him with little interaction with his second-youngest brother. The younger man, barely a man of six and ten years looked at him with the gaze of not contempt- Tywin would have beat that out of him if he dared- but a strong dislike that Tywin doubted would ever dispel. He did not care one way or another, as long as he gave him respect and obeyed him. He wore armor- something that was some attempt to differ himself from the rest of his brothers, no doubt- a plain thing that was barely gilded with gold set in swirls, with no jewels and polished to a modest sheen, his cloak a cotton instead of a velvet, not lined with dyed fur, but instead a simple black.\n",
      "He had bought all of his own armor, no doubt, with whatever money he could muster from Tourneys and the like.\n",
      "Tywin frowned.\n",
      "\"Dress yourself more appropriately. If you insist on armor, there is the set I commissioned for you in the armory with a better cloak. Have your squire help you dress.\"\n",
      "He watched a muscle work out against his square jaw.\n",
      "\"I thought the amour I wore regularly would suffice.\"\n",
      "\"It does not.\"\n",
      "He watched those blue eyes that he remembers belonging to their mother, flicker to the babe in his arms.\n",
      "\"Alright, I'll go change, my Lord,\" Tygett voice was polite, if a tad resigned, \"But I wished to inform you that all preparations are complete here at the Harbor. In accordance with the raven, the Princess should arrive sometime around midday, if the weather will hold. It looks like it has… The cradle is there, for the child if you wish to unburden-\"\n",
      "\"Go dress,\" he said, voice hard.\n",
      "Tygrett frowned, but gave him a polite bow, and made his leave. Tywin settled himself on the central chair, ignoring the crib to drape his daughter across his chest. He did take the time to remove a wool blanket and settle it around the child. He would remove it and demand the crib to be taken from the table the second he saw the Dornish ships. And they call the Lannisters overly demonstrative when Princess Meria decided to take the long route to the Rock by sea, with a small fleet of ten ships to carry her entire party and whatever gifts she thinks appropriate to give amongst the Houses along the coast. He signaled for some mild, warmed mead and sipped it leisurely as he waited for the rest of the core family members to appear. Areli fell asleep after he fed her a few sips of oatmeal, a soft, warm sensation of her heavy breaths against the crook of his neck.\n",
      "Kevan, like many times, was the first to appear, his new wife, Dorna Swift, at his side. She was nervous. Constantly nervous in his presence, due no doubt to her captivity after his father's death. He found it tedious to deal with her, as it may have been by his command, but it was her lord husband who had been her jailer, and she seemed to like him enough to ask her father to wed her to him. She dipped into a deep and respectful curtsy but said not a word before following her husband to sit at his right side. Tywin felt his jaw clench at the sight of his brother but gave him a sharp nod of greeting.\n",
      "\"Good morning.\"\n",
      "Tywin did not bother to respond, in no mood to observe niceties. He heard Kevan sigh, but Tywin did not acknowledge the sound by even glancing in his direction.\n",
      "\"I overstepped last night, my Lord.\"\n",
      "Again, Tywin did not respond.\n",
      "\"I ask for your forgiveness for my behavior.\"\n",
      "At that, Tywin had to respond.\n",
      "\"I care not to give it to you. Just never presume to demand such a thing of me again.\"\n",
      "Out of the corner of his eye, he watched as his brother closed his eyes and heaved another apologetic sigh.\n",
      "\"Of course, my lord,\" Then a curious expression crossed his face, \"Why was Tygett stomping his way up the ramps to the armory?\"\n",
      "Tywin almost smiled. Had he and Kevan not fought so the night before, he would have at least given the man a smirk.\n",
      "\"He is ill-dressed to receive the Princess,\" he replied, dryly, voice cool.\n",
      "Kevan did smile, while Dorna gave a soft and high giggle that was grating.\n",
      "\"I see. A habit of our brother, I see.\"\n",
      "\"Of both of them. If I recall, Gerion was once determined to meet the King in nothing but his small clothes,\" said Genna, loudly, holding a bundle of blankets that was no doubt the Imp.\n",
      "\"I was four namedays!\" said Gerion, hotly, crossing his arms. The boy of one and ten was just starting his progression into manhood, seemingly growing two feet since Tywin had seen him last.\n",
      "His elder twins, holding hands and near identical if not for Cersei's large skirt, giggled behind his youngest brother. They took their seats and begin what is sure to be a somewhat long wait for the Dornish to arrive. The day is spent pleasantly if tediously in the tent, with small refreshments provided and easy conversation after the initial tension, music gentle and provided by a small band that was typical to them.\n",
      "The general good mood, so little enjoyed for Tywin with Joanna gone, is broken entirely when Areli gave a startled shriek.\n",
      "\n",
      "OOOOOOOOOOOOO\n",

      "Joanna realized within seconds of her vague wish of wanting to follow her youngest from her brief dream, that she is not bound by the shared realm that had become her mind.\n",
      "She realized it because she is, without real form or logical pull, she is quite suddenly in front of Areli in the waking world, so close she could reach out to touch her as she does within the dream realm. Dreams are but a different realm, the world of the living seems to be no different. She stared, perplexed and something akin to panic within her at the sight of the people she had left behind. Tywin sat upon a chair, as if it is a throne, proud, gallant man, so thin, but flawlessly dressed, holding their youngest babe in his arms. Kevan held her second-born son in his arms, he too dressed in an altered frock that had once belonged to Jaime, golden to Areli's prominent crimson, on Tywin's right. My place. Cersei resplendent in gold is moving in her seat and is constantly and restlessly looking toward Tywin, eyes narrowed and on the bundle of velvet and lace that is her sister. Jaime is simply bouncing up and down in his red velvet, eyes on the horizon.\n",
      "She also realized as no one reacts, that they cannot see her.\n",
      "Or.\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "They cannot see her. Their eyes are still on the horizon, or on whoever they are speaking with. They look past her, not even flinching at the sudden appearance of a dead woman in front of them. But Areli can. She goes stock still in Tywin's arms, green eyes going frightfully large. She shrieks. A distressed warble that even makes her husband jump, looking down to the babe in his arms with a look of surprise.\n",
      "\"Shhh. Sweetling, I am just as surprised as you are.\"\n",
      "Areli cannot speak back to her, not outside of her dreams where the realm is so vividly attuned to what her spirit is. Not without giving the people around her an indication of her intelligence and unnatural sentience. Cautious, wise girl. Tywin would be alarmed. He is not one for fantasy or magic. Areli can only stare at her, and even in her semi-mute state, even in her infant face, Joanna can see her genuine fright her. My babe, so frightened of me. But only for the reasons I know to be reasonable, no matter how much it hurts me. I am the one to coax her into forgoing the life she had before she quickened within my womb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shh, little Strangerling, shhh sweet girl that came to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wished to see you, little lioness,\" she gave her voice as a prim, warm thing, thinly disguising the fact that she has no need to explain herself, even to her daughter. She tries to ignore her voice, not what it was in life, but even to her instead but a whisper on the winds blowing into the Lion's Harbor, \"And I found in the process that we are more closely bound that I could predict. It appears that realms of your dreams are not the only place I can find you in.\"\n",
      "Areli cannot answer, and for that Joanna uses to her advantage. She extends her hands, only pauses for a moment at their transparency, before she presses them to both Areli's cheeks. Her little cub's eyes narrow, but she does not make another cry of distress. Tywin, oh how thin you have grown my love, shifts, his dark eyes unseeing, flickering away from her face as if nothing was there before they turn on their youngest daughter. He does not soothe her. That is not his way, not in public, not to anyone but Joanna. He only instead pressed a hand on her stomach, a silent, gentle act that is meant to remind the babe that he is present. Areli reacted, automatic, as the gesture is familiar- How that gladdens me- curling her hands around Tywin's thumb and forefinger. Tywin relaxed at the gesture, a slow rumble of a breath that passed in a fraction of a second. He too liked the gesture. She watched with keen, knowing eyes as whatever tension that had come to him from Areli's shriek left the proud hold of his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good. I suppose your yearning for gentleness has not died with my body, Tywin. Areli would give it as I had before, and you seem ready to receive it yet, my love.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's wrong with it?\" and that's her little Cersei, voice high, curious, but unhappy.\n",
      "Joanna can only suck in a breath at the innocent question that her eldest gave. If she is to be the Queen that Tywin wishes her to be, she must learn to control her impulses. What have I told you a million times, my little love, of holding your tongue?\n",
      "\"Cersei,\" the voice that Tywin gave is of pure coolness, displeasure clear enough that Cersei's delicate shoulders draw slightly inward, \"She is not an it. Do not refer to your sister as such.\"\n",
      "Cersei's little fist clenched.\n",
      "\"I do not have a sister.\"\n",
      "Joanna cannot, despite the dangerous territory that her eldest is blundering through, cannot help but find a parallel.\n",
      "\"It looks like you and your sister are in agreement, Areli.\"\n",
      "The look that Areli gave her is the sternest, most unimpressed thing. What a look- You make your father proud if you are so ready to give your disapproval!\n",
      "\"You have one. Two brothers and one younger sister.\"\n",
      "\"I do no-\"\n",
      "\"The House of Lannister has been blessed with four children. The heir, Jaime, the… The second son, Tyrion, the eldest Cersei, and the youngest, Areli. Recite it.\"\n",
      "\"But Father-\"\n",
      "\"Cersei, repeat what I have recited to you.\"\n",
      "\"NO-\"\n",
      "\"Repeat it or you will be escorted to your quarters where you will remain until I deem it acceptable to leave them. Perhaps you are not interested in seeing the Dornish Princess. I see you do not wish to present yourself to our esteemed guests. \"\n",
      "\"But Mother always spoke of the Princess-\"\n",
      "\"I do not repeat orders.\"\n",
      "Cersei's lower lip trembled, but as Tywin lifted a hand to gesture to one of the many maids standing, she gave a breathless gasp.\n",
      "\"The House of Lannister has been blessed with four children. The heir, Jaime, the second son, Tyrion, the eldest Cersei, and the youngest, Areli.\"\n",
      "Tywin looked to Cersei. His jaw was tight.\n",
      "\"Again.\"\n",
      "\"But I-\"\n",
      "Tywin went to lift his hand again. Cersei quickly began the phrase again, and again. Tywin looked away from their eldest child and only said, \"Again.\" At each time the girl finished the phrase. Joanna watched as Tywin made their eldest repeat the phrase, with a tired sigh. Cersei's voice went hoarse as the early morning changed to mid-morning. When she reached for a chalice for some sort of refreshment, Joanna was not surprised that Tywin made the servants remove it from the table in front of Cersei. Looking close to furious tears, Cersei could only swallow with a dry throat and begin the phrase again.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I could speak to you I would be upset at you, Tywin. Upset… But knowing of the lesson you are trying to instill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cersei said the words again and again until bright orange sails were seen on the horizon, by mid-afternoon. Tywin lifted a hand before he commanded that a single glass of lukewarm water was given to their eldest daughter. With a trembling hand, and under Tywin's gaze, Cersei drank the goblet. She drank carefully, mindful and as perfectly as Joanna could expect of a child of four name days.\n",
      "\"Let you remember this Cersei,\" Tywin said, calmly, drinking at his preferred wine. The goblet he was using shined in the sunlight, gems twinkling, \"A Lannister does not deny other Lannisters. If I am to hear such things from you again, you will not have a drop to drink, to make you hold your tongue. You will go mute before you deny your siblings again. Am I understood?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, father,\" croaked Cersei. Despite how high her voice was, she sounded akin to an old woman.\n",
      "Tywin gave a nod, before looking away from their eldest to once again look at the ever approaching ships. Joanna wanted- Joanna wanted to touch her daughter. She wanted to press her hands to the small tears in her eyes, wanted to soothe those golden curls. But she did not dare. Cersei would not feel it. She is not touched by the Stranger, she is too much like Tywin to even begin to understand how life and death are much more similar than she could know. Joanna looked to her youngest, looked at her youngest and sees the horror and disgust in her young face.\n",
      "\"He is not a monster,\" she told her, and what else could she say?\n",
      "Green eyes looked to her, and Areli frowned. Joanna gave her a sad smile.\n",
      "\"He did it to defend you, to show that you are truly a Lannister. Cersei is so stubborn- So hurt over my death. You must be glad that your father defends you and Tyrion. It is the only way for her to understand.\"\n",
      "Areli's face twisted and she seemed to be holding back tears.\n",
      "\"Understand him truly before you cast judgment. He is a great man.\"\n",
      "Areli twisted sharply in Tywin's arms. Tywin, surprised, but quick to react, held his hand to her stomach once again. Areli bared a toothless snarl, moving violently in her father's arms with a determination. A stubbornness.\n",
      "\"You'll hurt yourself.\"\n",
      "\"Calm yourself,\" said Tywin, a note of displeasure coming into his voice, something almost akin to distress also in there.\n",
      "\"Areli- Sto-\"\n",
      "Areli gave a wordless cry of defiance, leaning forward and glaring directly at Joanna in what- In what looks like true hate.\n",
      "\"Is she alright?\" and Jaime, and he jumped from his place, crawling over the laps of his uncles and aunt, over Cersei to reach for his younger sister.\n",
      "As if sensing his twin's distress, or perhaps just hearing her enraged shrieks, Tyrion started to cry. Cersei looked on with narrowed, hurt eyes.\n",
      "\"Calm yourself,\" Tywin said, voice no louder than before, but much more dangerous.\n",
      "\"Areli I beg you to STOP!\"\n",
      "By some miracle, she does. Or perhaps she realized that her point is made. You will try and defy who you are, then? Even after all these moons? She looked at her with a heaving chest, her gums still barred. Joanna can see the defiance in her eyes. Joanna felt her jaw clench, had she been alive, flesh, the pressure would no doubt be enough to give her a headache. But she still reached for her youngest daughter, hands out in a soothing gesture. Areli shook her head- once, twice. A clear indicator that she does not wish for her touch. In the world of the living, Joanna decided to follow her choice- cannot help but do it in the wake of Areli obvious power to distress her family. Choose your battles. You think you have won, my Strangeling? You think this is enough to make me stop?\n",
      "\"Please,\" the breathless whisper of her voice is a tool, a weapon against this undecided child that is in a position to do so much for their family, \"Please do not hurt yourself.\"\n",
      "\"Calm yourself,\" repeated Tywin, softer, and uncharacteristically revealed.\n",
      "Tyrion cries are settled much swifter, Genna bouncing the squawking child in easy movements.\n",
      "\"You should not be so unruly, Areli,\" he said, voice turning colder.\n",
      "Areli shivered, looking up at Tywin with contempt, that wavered at the look he is giving her. Stern, yes, but his eyes speak of so much more. Worry. Affection. Good, my love. She knew she is cared for. She knew that Tywin is very close to almost adoring her, in that distance, but a palpable way of his. Joanna gave her a sad, gentle smile.\n",
      "\"And remember little lioness… You are where you belong.\"\n",

      "AN:\n",
      "EDIT: 17 December 2019\n",
      "Okay, I rarely leave an author's note for Lion-Heart, so I ended up making a novel-length one for this chapter:\n",
      "It made my skin crawl the thought of a small child being denied anything to drink, for hours, and forced to speak around their parched throat. It may seem like a light punishment, but being dehydrated is no goddamn joke, especially for a child that young. It's not because Tywin is not capable. Let me make it clear in this moment that my goal is not to make Tywin all sunshine and rainbows and goodness and sugar drops.\n",
      "That is never been my goal in this, with any of the Lannisters, but especially with him.\n",
      "Tywin, in my eyes, is still a goddamn monster. However, I am humanizing him. Even the most monstrous of people can show kindness, can show affection to specific people. Areli is stuck in the middle of a place where our moderns standards of humanity and morality just do not apply. That doesn't justify Tywin's past and future actions, but it does, however, change their context and how she has to interpret them. She's between a rock and a hard place, and Joanna whispering in her ear has her all types of confused, especially because Areli is compassionate and in a lot of grief at the moment. But as shown in the chapter, she won't be so easily swayed but will be confused.\n",
      "Abuse wise, I wanted to mention that early sexual activity/acts is a common sign of abuse or neglect in children. Cersei and Jaime were supposed to have been caught by Joanna doing something sexual. They would have been very young, and that is not normal behavior for children. I've taken that and generally thought about Tysha as a springboard on how harshly Tywin disciplines all of his children. Even in the books and the show, the adult Lannisters show a certain amount of cowness to their father that is more than a warranted reaction to his domineering personality.\n",
      "In regards to Cersei in general, I've been getting two different types of comments that made me want to address her: She appears to be a tad cartoonish or, conversely, to essentially kill off the character as soon as possible. She will not be fully fleshed out until all of the children are a little older. Cersei, in both the books and in the show, is a grown woman. A grown woman that is not a good person, not even remotely, due to the circumstances of her childhood, her marriage, etc. She is cruel, vindictive and paranoid. She has made monstrous decisions that have at the very least, killed a lot of people via civil war, or straight-up murdered babies in their mother's arms(Robert's children).\n",
      "In Lion-Heart, as of now, she is four-years-old. Four. She's a brat, plain and simple, a brat who has recently lost her mother, and she is lashing out as a four-year-old does. I'm not saying that she is initially a good person. At the earliest, there is a possibility that Cersei has murdered someone at the age of eleven. If not, she was somehow involved. I'm willing to bet the former rather than the later, not because I don't think her capable. It's just rare for a child to actively kill someone. In the way it's phrased in canon, it is left fairly ambiguous for the viewer/reader to interpret.\n",
      "She isn't evil, however, not at that moment. Not a lot of four-year-olds are evil. But I feel, much like Jaime, that had Cersei never fallen into a relationship with her twin, never married Robert, she would have been an infinitely better person. Not necessarily good, but perhaps better. Lion-Heart is an exploration of that, of all the Lannisters having their fate changed. The Lannisters are fascinating to me as characters, hence my choice for placing my OC in their family. Areli is a stone dropped into a still pond(I'm funny because that's a pun on how she died)- she unsettles the water, rings starting small but growing larger and larger as time goes on.\n",
      "On the subject of a time skip: it will occur the second the Dornish delegation is set to leave. After that, I will have a brief 'intermission' chapter of Areli's cornerstones of development from ages one to three, and the chapter after that will be a skip straight to Areli and Tyrion's presentation at the Royal Court, with them being around four, and then another intermission chapter until the Tourney that took place at Lannisport after Viserys' birth. I know Areli being a baby can be a tad boring to some, but a lot of things were happening around the time that Tyrion was born, and it was too interesting to skip out on. Not to mention I want to set up the dynamics of the family. So, just bare with me for a little bit.\n",
